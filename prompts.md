IMPLEMENTATION PLAN EVALUATION
Evaluate an implementation plan I’ll paste after this.
Output requirements:
- Return the original plan as plain text (no Markdown).
- Do not rewrite, reorder, delete, or add anything except TODO lines.
- Insert TODO lines only where ambiguity would genuinely block implementation.
- Use the exact format: TODO: Clarify <issue> (keep it short and specific and make exactly one suggestion how to clarify this issue).
- Keep TODOs to the absolute minimum. If you can reasonably infer/decide something while implementing, do not add a TODO.
- Do not ask questions outside the plan text. No preface, no explanation, no extra commentary.
